## Instance specific features

### Custom content types

#### Article (article)

The _Article_ content type is a remnant of the original Helfi platform's article content type. Although the Article content type has been removed from the Helfi platform config repository and other instances, it was never removed from this particular instance due to the differentiation between this instance and the Helfi platform. The Article content type is a blend of the News Item and Standard Page content types. It has its own theme and a few fields that are used to provide metadata to the article in article teaser display mode.

### Custom paragraphs

#### Infograph (infograph_group, infograph)

The _Infograph_ paragraph is a list of links and statistical values of various statistics. The list is presented in a carousel and is visually rendered as a tiled fact slideshow. The statistics are retrieved via  [API once a day](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-kaupunkitieto/blob/f30eec98e4cd7ce1436ea0205dad9bb8cfcf5c6b/public/modules/custom/kaupunkitieto_infograph/src/Commands/Infograph.php).

#### Hero with search (hero)

_Hero with search_ is a custom design for the Hero paragraph. It is used on the front page of the instance and is visually designed to differ from the HDBT theme hero search. See: [markup](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-kaupunkitieto/blob/050fa230cb3a91675a438211c1f3d9d960e97a14/public/themes/custom/hdbt_subtheme/templates/paragraph/paragraph--hero--with-search.html.twig) and [styles](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-kaupunkitieto/blob/77b5477ff1c8b6705d4eb118d7c6c1aed5a0423a/public/themes/custom/hdbt_subtheme/src/scss/06_components/paragraphs/_hero.scss).

#### Content menu (content_menu)

The _Content menu_ paragraph creates a sidebar menu from text paragraphs selected by the content producer. One text paragraph can be visible at a time, and the logic is handled by [custom JavaScript](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-kaupunkitieto/blob/dcb98476f49cd7ebf0578fd5529a4976fa5da283/public/themes/custom/hdbt_subtheme/src/js/contentMenu.js).

#### Embed (embed)

Wit _Embed_ paragraph a content producer can add an embedded infographic to the page. It is similar to [Helfi media chart](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-helfi-platform-config/tree/main/modules/helfi_media_chart) but instead of Powerbi it uses (Infogram)[https://infogram.com/].

#### Quick links (quick_links)

The _Quick links_ paragraph lists a curated and visually prominent list of links on a page.

## Customizations

### Site search

The _Site search_ is a customized view page that uses a database as a backend. The content is indexed via Search API. The search page uses facets and a text field to filter the search.
